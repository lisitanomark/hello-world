Hello!

My name is Mark and I am interested in becoming a Software Engineer. I am currently learning the basics of Python, Ruby, Html, and CSS, and want to learn as much as possbile with free resources before possibly investing my time into a coding bootcamp. I am curious to learn about the opportunities that coding can bring!
